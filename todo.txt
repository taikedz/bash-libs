# More to do

* move libs/ to src/ and pre-build the libs/ directory so that functions that use syntax extensions can be sourced directly
    * do not include syntax-extensions.sh though - that should remain the responsibility of the end developer
* Define new location for libs to live -- OK
* Move syntax-extensions.sh to bash-builder's scope
    * to install to ~/.local/lib/bbuild/build-support
